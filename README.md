This is the consolidated repository holding the source for all components in the Basic Web Components project. This repo is intended for component development, and for running component demos locally.

# Introduction

The Basic Web Components project seeks to provide a comprehensive set of solid, well-designed web components that implement very common user interface patterns. Each component can be used as is, or as the foundation for new components.

These components are not intended to be flashy or exciting. They are meant to serve as solid building blocks for your applications and user experiences. Careful factoring of user interface concerns attempts to give you components, helpers, base classes, mixins, etc., that you can readily combine (or recombine) to create solid custom components to meet your own needs.

These components try to measure up to the [Gold Standard for web components](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki). That standard sets a very high bar for component quality, attempting to make web components as flexible and reliable as the standard build-in HTML elements.

# Repository organization

All the interesting work on Basic Web Components happens in this repository, known as the "consolidated" repository. This contains the source for all the basic- components in a single place, which makes it simple to clone and develop in. The source for each component is in a separate subfolder under the /src folder. E.g., the source for basic-autosize-textarea is found in /src/basic-autosize-textarea.

For registration and deployment via Bower, the individual components are copied into separate repositories. E.g., the source for basic-autosize-textarea will be copied from /src/basic-autosize-textarea in this repo to the individual component repo [basic-autosize-textarea](https://github.com/basic-web-components/basic-autosize-textarea). This is done via a deployment script. From there, the component source is registered with Bower. When someone wants to use basic-autosize-textarea in a project, Bower will pull the files from the individual component repo.

This compromise arrangement greatly simplifies component development (in this consolidated repo here) while still support Bower's need to have components live in their own individual repos.

# Using this repository to run demos

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Find the component you are interested in the /src folder.
3. Open the index.html page for that component to view its demo.

# Localization with Globalize.js

The culture-dependent components (e.g., basic-calendar-month) use [Globalize.js]
(https://github.com/jquery/globalize) for localization. For testing and
demonstration purposes, this repository currently pulls in a *huge* set of
culture data files under bower_components/cldr-data. This is obviously not
ideal — we hope to find a better way to organize things in the future.

# Installing these components via Bower

Each of these components is separately installable via [Bower](https://bower.io), so you can use just the components you want in your project. To install a component (e.g., basic-autosize-textarea) in your project, add a line to the `dependencies` key in your project's bower.json file:

```
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "basic-autosize-textarea": "basic-web-components/basic-autosize-textarea#master"
  },
}
```

For more information on each component's purpose and API, see the formatted [documentation](http://basic-web-components.github.io/basic-web-components/docs).

# Contributing

The Basic Web Components project is open source under the MIT license. The project is led by [Component Kitchen](http://component.kitchen) and sponsored by Google. The Basic Web Components project encourages you to join in and contribute general-purpose components to this effort! We'd love the help.

* We'd prefer to have issues filed against this consolidate repository, rather than the individual deployment repositories for individual components.
* Please submit PRs against this repository, not the invididual component repositories. Those individual component repos are for deployment only.
* Code should follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).
* To the extent possible, components should try to measure up to the [Gold Standard for web components](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki).

# Desired components

If you're interested in creating a web component that others can use, why not take a shot at one of the general-purpose components below and help us complete the collection? If one of these interests you, feel free to run your plan/idea/questions by project member [Jan Miksovsky](https://github.com/JanMiksovsky).

* Accordion. A list that can have a single item or multiple items expanded to show more detail. Should be built upon polymer-selector.
* Alphabetic indices. Renders the characters in a culture’s alphabet in standard order (e.g., as a vertical or horizontal strip). If supplied with a set of strings (or array of objects with key pointing to the important data member?), the UI will disable those characters which are not found as the initial character of any string.
* Async operation button. A button whose caption changes to reflect an operation in progress (e.g., changing from “Sign In” to “Signing In...”) until the operation completes. The button is disabled during the operation to avoid confusion and to prevent unnecessary extra clicks.
* Auto-complete. A text input field that helps the user quickly enter strings from a known list. This is similar to a combo box, which is arguably better because it adds a button to dropdown and see the list of choices without having to first type. That said, nearly all web implementations of auto-complete have no button to show the choices.
* Auto-format. Applies a collection of heuristics for formatting text: adding smart quotes, converts double hyphens to endashes, etc.
* Backdrop. Shows a background region of non-interactive elements behind the region’s main contents.
* Breadcrumb bar. Indicates the user’s position in a navigational hierarchy.
* Browser-specific. Conditionally shows contents based on the browser being used and/or whether the current browser supports a given feature.
* Calendar month navigator. Lets the user select a date, typically in the near future, by navigating through calendar months.
* Calendar months. Shows multiple months from a calendar.
* Central column. A region whose main central column is fixed in width, and horizontally centered with respect to the viewport.
* Checked list box. A list box showing a check box next to each item; the user can create a multiple selection by checking the boxes.

* Color wheel. Lets the user select a color in a variety of color spaces.
* Combed text box. A text box sporting tick marks or vertical lines to visually indicate how many characters should be entered. (Combine with masked input?)
* Content with banner(s), such as toolbar (on top) or status bar (on the bottom).
* Content with sidebar(s) on the left and/or right side.

* List box. A list that supports single selection, including keyboard navigation.
* List combo box. A combo box which presents its choices as a dropdown list.
* List with detail pane. A list box showing a set of items, paired with a means of showing properties of the selected item. These properties are either a pane (usually to the right) on desktop or tablet devices, or a separate page on mobile devices with smaller screens.
* Log. Displays a growing text log showing, for example, the output of an ongoing process.
* Masked text. A text box which only accepts specified input characters.
* Menu bar. A row of menus.
* Menu item. A command in a menu.

* Sprite. Shows a single image at a time from a strip or grid of images.
* Stacked navigation pages. As the user navigates deeper in an app, a small residual portion of the previous page remains visible (typically on the left); the user can swipe away the top page to navigate back to an earlier point.
* Star rating. Lets the user rate something (a restaurant, product, etc.) using the conventional star system. An attribute allows the glyph
* Tab strip. A set of tab buttons, typically used to navigate among tabbed pages presenting different content, but which can also be used, for example, to apply one of a set of filters to a results list.
* Tab. A tabbed page which can be hosted in a set of tabs.
* Tabs. A set of pages which can be navigated by a set of tab buttons across the top. Uses basic-modes to actually handle determining which child element is shown.
