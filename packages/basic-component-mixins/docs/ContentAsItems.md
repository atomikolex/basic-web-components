<a name="ContentAsItems"></a>
## ContentAsItems
Mixin which maps content semantics (children) to list item
semantics

Items differ from children in several ways:

* They are often referenced via index.
* They may have a selection state.
* It's common to do work to initialize the appearance or state of a new item.
* Auxiliary invisible child elements are filtered out and not counted as
  items. Auxiliary elements include link, script, style, and template
  elements.

**Kind**: global class
