# basic-sliding-viewport

Presents list items in a viewport such that only a single item is visible at a
time. Navigating between items will be represented with a horizontal visual
sliding effect.

This component currently requires that you explicitly apply a size to it. For a
variant which automatically sizes to its content, see the related component
basic-sliding-viewport-fit.
