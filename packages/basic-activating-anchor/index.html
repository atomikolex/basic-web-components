  <p>
    The links on this page highlight themselves as appropriate. They will appear
    active (bold) when the current page address matches their link destination.
    As an example, the links below navigate to anchors within the page. As you
    navigate (by clicking, editing the address bar, going back/forward), the
    links will update their own active state.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <basic-activating-anchor href="#one">One</basic-activating-anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <basic-activating-anchor href="#two">Two</basic-activating-anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <basic-activating-anchor href="#three">Three</basic-activating-anchor>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A link of this type can also represent an area within a site, not just a
    single page. Such a link will be active whenever the user is at a
    destination at or below the point in the navigational hierarchy indicated
    by the link's destination.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <basic-activating-anchor href="./">Page link</basic-activating-anchor>.
      The link only appears active when the current page address matches the
      link destination. In this demo, it will only appear active if there is
      no "#" hash anchor in the address bar.
    </li>
    <li>
      <basic-activating-anchor href="./" area-link='true'>Area link</basic-activating-anchor>.
      The link goes to the same destination as the page link above, but appears
      active whenever the current page address matches the prefix indicated by
      the link destination. In this demo, it will always show as active.
    </li>
  </ul>
