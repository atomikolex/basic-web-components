<a name="CollapsiblePanel"></a>
## CollapsiblePanel
A panel which can be expanded/collapsed with an animated transition.

This component combines the Collapsible mixin and a simple CSS height
animation.

This component handles only the duties of collapsing and expanding. It does
not provide a user interface for the user to trigger the change in state;
you must provide that user interface yourself.

**Kind**: global class  
**Mixes**: <code>Collapsible</code>
