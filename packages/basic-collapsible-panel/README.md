## CollapsiblePanel ‚áê <code>ElementBase</code>
A panel which can be expanded/collapsed with an animated transition.

This component combines the OpenClose mixin and a simple CSS height
animation.

not provide a user interface for the user to trigger the change in state;
you must provide that user interface yourself.
