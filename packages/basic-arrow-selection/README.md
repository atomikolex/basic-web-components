## basic-arrow-direction
Mixin used to add prominent left and right arrow buttons to a wrapped child.
Clicking the left/right buttons selects the previous/next item.

By default, the arrow buttons are shown on devices with a mouse or mouse-like
point device; they are not shown on a touch-capable device unless mouse
movement is detected. To cause the buttons to always appear, apply the
'showArrows' CSS class.

**Kind**: global class
